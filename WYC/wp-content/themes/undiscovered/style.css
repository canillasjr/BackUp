Description: The Undiscovered theme for WordPress is a simple and elegant blogging suite, featuring a wide range of post formats. It is fully responsive and Retina-ready, so it has the ability to adapt to any screen size or resolution. It looks great on each and every web-enabled device from large desktop computers to smartphones. Interactive customization options have been added using Wordpress Theme Customization API. Theme Customizer allows users to make changes to the theme and see the results in real-time before them being applied to the live site. There are some styling options available, including a few color settings, logo upload and 20+ custom fonts. Colored icons are all vector images, so their appearance can also be tweaked via options panel. You don't need extensions to add links to your social media profiles, because it's a built-in feature of this theme with 18 networks to choose from.
